What it does in game:
The player should be able to navigate/traverse/inspect the environment in some way. Controlling what the camera’s see’s and where the player is in the diorama. [we make it so can move with map open cos camera will be behind character and able to be able to move camera 360 around character

This controller should have parameters that the designer can use to edit how the player moves through the environment. Such as speed, sensitivity and camera focus.

The controller should also have some tutorial in game as to how to use it.

What it does in editor:
The controller should have a detailed explanation of what kind of controller it is, and how it is intended to be used/what game style and design it is intended for.

The controller should feature parameters that can be used to lightly customise it for the designer's diorama, and intended experience. These could be things like min and max speed for a flight controller, path for a on rails camera, turntable viewing, or camera positions and tracking speed for a resident evil style system.
